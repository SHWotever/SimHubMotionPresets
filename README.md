A collection of settings for Simhub motion (Geometry and controllers) which can't be supported natively in respect of the licence and/or due to the lack of documentations allowing to warranty the support over time and updates :

By using one of those presets you must comply to the respective usage licenses of each controller. Presets are delivered without warranty.
The presets files themselves are under unlicence, feel free to use, reause adapt, take inspiration to drive any controllers you may want.
